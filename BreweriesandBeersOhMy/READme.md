# Introduction
A group of friends tasked us with analyzing the the craft beer and micro-brewery industry in the United States to determine which area of the country they should visit to take a beer and brewery tour.  With visions of wheat, barley and hops in our minds, we set off to 
gather the data and create a compelling argument that when it comes to craft beers and microbrews, the west might just be best.   

## Methods
This repository holds the analysis of the data and contains two csv files and one RMarkdown file. One csv file contains 
information about breweries (breweries.csv) and the other contains information about beers (beers.csv). In the RMarkdown file we merge 
these two data sets and conduct analysis on the resulting data set. All files are located in the Case_study_1_Git_Hub folder.
