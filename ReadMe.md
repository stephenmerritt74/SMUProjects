### Introduction

---

Hi, I'm Steve Merritt, a recently transitioned military veteran.  For 20 years, I proudly served as an Officer and Aviator in the United States Navy.  The culminating role of my career was serving as the Commanding Officer of the finest Helicopter Squadron in the Navy, the HSC-11 DragonSlayers.  To this day, I am still humbled by the opportunity that was entrusted to me in leading 250 of this Nation's finest men and women in amazingly rewarding work.  

Along the way, we also got to some pretty cool stuff like [this](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11-Dsjz6g5VQzNAheFw__-NFchUt_r1y6).


It was during this final tour, where my passion for data began.  It all started with a problem.  As the CO of a squadron, a lot of administrative tasks require your attention, but none more important than the daily flight schedule.  My schedulers would spend hours everyday painstakingly combing through 60 different qualifications (attributes or features) of 60 different pilots (observations) to make sure they chose the right pilot for the job.  Imagine, manually combing through a 60 x 60 matrix everyday to make, at times, life and death decisions.  

There had to be a better way!  

Enter Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) in Excel!  Ughhh, I know, who uses Excel??  Remember, I was a beginner then!  I took an online course to learn some basic VBA programming skills, and within a couple days I had written just 15 lines of VBA code that would automatically comb through this matrix and choose the 5-6 right pilots who were most qualified to fly the mission.  We tested it for a few weeks against the manual process, but the message from schedulers quickly came back loud and clear.  

The code worked and save them a ton of time.  

I WAS NOW HOOKED ON DATA!
