This repository contains all the necessary information to evaluate and predict housing prices in Ames Iowa.  The Ames, IA housing dataset originated from the Ames Assessorâ€™s Office and is used in computing assessed values for individual residential properties sold in Ames, IA from 2006 to 2010.  This analysis will be used to generate predictions of the Sale Price for 1,459 homes in and around Ames, IA.  A more thorough description can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
